In order to take measurements, the appropriate number of selections need to be made - two selections to measure distance, three selections to measure angles, and four selections to measure dihedrals. Without the appropriate number of selections, the measurement options will not be available for use. See <a href="making-selections.html#selection-mode">Selection Mode</a> for information on making selections.</p><p>The measurement will be made based on which <a href="making-selections.html#picking-level">Picking Level</a> is used for the selections. When the selections are atoms, the measurements will be made from the center of the atoms. If another Picking Level, such as residues or chains, is used, the measurements will be made using points from the center of the space that the selection occupies. This means that if three residues are selected for an angle measurement, the angle will not be taken from the alpha carbon, but from a point from the center of the space the residue takes up.</p><p>Within the Measurements Panel, the selections can be toggled up and down using arrows that show up next to them.

Within a Mol* session, users are able to create “views” which contain all the information in the 3D canvas at the time the views were saved. Multiple views can be saved in a single session. The Session Panel can only be accessed at <a href="https://molstar.org/viewer/">molstar.org/viewer/</a> and is located in the Controls Panel.</p><p><b>Saving Views:</b> The Views menu is used to save views in Mol*.

Mol* performs superpositions by matching selected chains or atoms. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the superposed structures will be listed in the Log Panel at the bottom of the application window. To access the Superposition Panel, two or more structures must be <a href="managing-the-display.html#import-panel">uploaded</a> at <a href="https://molstar.org/viewer/">molstar.org/viewer</a>.

Regions of a chain can also be selected for superposition. For each PDB entry, <a href="making-selections.html#selection-mode">selections</a> must be limited to single polymer <a href="making-selections.html#picking-level">chains</a> per structure. If using a region of a chain, only one region per chain can be used for each structure. After making two or more selections, click “Superpose” to superpose the structures in the 3D canvas. While the superposition is per chain, the resulting 3D transformation is always applied to the whole structure. When superposing more than two structures, note that the alignment is done to the first structure. The RMSD will be listed in the Log Panel.</p><div style="margin: 15px 0;"><img src="./img/superpositionchains.png" alt="RCSB PDB News Image" class="img-responsive" style="width: 200px;"></div><div style="margin: 15px 0;"><img src="./img/superpositionchainsselection.png" alt="RCSB PDB News Image" class="img-responsive" style="width: 200px;"></div><p><b>Superposing by Atoms:</b> In order to superpose structures by atoms, one or more atoms from separate structures must be selected. <a href="making-selections.html#selection-mode">Select</a> one or more <a href="making-selections.html#picking-level">atoms</a> and click “Superpose” to superpose the structures in the 3D canvas.
